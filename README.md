# DS6600_lab1

For this repository, I chose the GNU General Public License (GPL v3.0) because it permits commercial and non-commercial use, allows modification and distribution of the code, and enforces copyleft, meaning that any redistributed versions of the code must also be licensed under GPL-3.0. If a license was not supplied, this repository would default to "all rights reserved" copyright. This means that others cannot legally use, modify, or distribute the code without explicit permission.

Below is the section in the .gitignore file that hides environmental variables:
