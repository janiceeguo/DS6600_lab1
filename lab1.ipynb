    "The best option would be a container, since it allows each chapter to run their own copy of the portal and app, but using the same code. Since containers can package code to be deployed regardless of local infrastrucutre setup, it also complements large storage capabilities that are easily accesible over the internet. Virtual machines are not necessary since each chapter doesn't need a full, isolated operating system, it just needs a packaged container so that the applications can run consistently - this option is also usually not free. Virtual environments only really isolate programing language dependencies, which wouldn't be enough to run separate instances of the application for each chapter with their own database. Global environments are even less powerful - too many issues could arrise across chapters like dependency and version clashes."
